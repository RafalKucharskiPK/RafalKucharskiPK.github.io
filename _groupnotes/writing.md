Good writing is vital to getting credit for the work you have done. It can easily make the difference between publishing in a high impact journal and a low impact journal.

# Software
The group’s preferred tool for writing is [overleaf](<http://www.overleaf.com>), which is an online latex editor. Mark has subscription for this, which allows multiple users and tracked changes if he created the initial project. Pretty much all journals accept latex these days. More likely than not, we already have a suitable template, but if you can almost certainly find one of the website of the relevant journal. We do use word from time-to-time, which is easy to use and has good tools for tracking changes, but is not as good at handling re-ordered text and references. For figures, we suggest the python package [matplotlib](<https://matplotlib.org/>).

# Suggested steps for preparing a manuscript
Do not imagine that you can just write everything perfectly and then submit it after checking for typos– almost everyone needs to revise and re-order their initial text. Writing a good paper is hard! We suggest the following sequence
1.	Each paper should make one, maybe two, key points. Write these down in order to focus on them and consider changing them as you tighten up exactly the best way to convey your message.
1.	Construct the figures together with a sequence of bullet points conveying the story you want to get across. Think about what order is best.
1.	I usually like to collect the relevant references at this point and dump them into the manuscript. Your manuscript needs put new discoveries made in this word front and center, while being careful to do justice to what has been done before.
1.	Draft the figure captions and the body of paper describing the data. Tell the reader what they should pay attention to: Don’t just refer to the data and expect them to work it out for themselves.
1. Draft the conclusions. Shorter is usually better here.
1. The introduction is probably the hardest paper of the paper to write. which is why I suggest writing it last after you are very familiar with the material in question. A good introduction starts from a general conceptual problem and logically argues that there is an important unknown question, which is the question that the paper solves. For high impact journals, you will usually want to make the introduction as short as possible as this makes the work more exciting and keep the reader focused on your data. If there is some boilerplate info you need the reader to know, it is still okay to locate this in the body of the paper while discussing the data.
1. At this point, there are almost certainly multiple ways to improve the paper. Repeat the previous steps and consider whether you can make better choices for the order of the argument, the points to emphasize and the way that the work is presented in the context of the literature.

# Things to check for
1.	Remember that the audience is not a mind reader. If a sentence is a little difficult for you to parse, it will likely be missed completely by the audience. For better or worse, the onus is on you to convey your ideas even if the reader is lazy! Anyone who was read more than one or two referee reports will have seen that ideas often are often missed by even alleged experts.
1.	Many students are taught that papers should be written exclusively in the third person past tense. This will make the work unbearably boring to read! Ignore this rule!
1.	 It is best to use a variety of first, second, third person as appropriate. Try reading papers in the journal you are aiming for to get a sense of what is best.
1.	Tenses: In science we are aiming for statements that are generally true: now, in the past and in the future. The simple present tense is the appropriate to convey this: use it  is as your “go to” sentence construction.
1.	It is usually better to put action in verbs: “we analyzed the data” is usually better than “we performed analysis on the data”. Some examples of verbs reformed into nouns are:
regulation,
analysis,
occurance,
understanding,
investigation,
deliniation,
and performance.
Check for these and consider replacing them.
1.	Short sentences are easier and clearer to read than long ones. Tend towards writing in short sentences and avoid sequences of many long sentences. (This is not a hard-and-fast rule.)
1.	Multiple run on sentences with the same construction usually reflects bad or lazy writing.
