At any one time, the group assigns one person to look after the day-to-day operation of our Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer. There are three main tasks:

# Good lab practice
Ensure that the lab is kept tidy without unlabeled samples nor loose razor blades. Pay particular care to ensure that delicate optical components are not left in unsafe locations.

# Switch off Bruker during the monthly generator test
Approximately once a month, there is a building generator test that causes a power dip to the whole building. In order to avoid damage to machine we must ensure that the system is off during these tests. Speak to Mark or Lynn Cohen to get the schedule.

# Cooling water maintenance
The x-ray tube is cooled by three water circuits. An internal closed circuit within the Bruker cools the tube itself. This circuit is cooled by the Haskris unit. We replace the water in both circuits every six months and clean the mesh filter every three months. The Haskris unit dumps its heat into the processed chilled water provided by the building.
## Internal closed circuit
The water in this circuit should be exchanged every six months and the filter cleaned every three months. Follow these steps:  
1. Remove the water from the internal reservoir. This can be done in two ways depending on what you find most convenient:  
a) Switch off the system. Insert the shop vac into the water reservoir or and suck out the water. Remember that the filter inside the shop vac should be removed in order to avoid getting it wet.  
b) With the tube off, unplug the quick connectors at the tube head and inset the spare quick connects to keep the ball valves open. In order to remove the water, operate the pump using the service mode of the tools page in the Bruker software.
1. Clean the mesh filter. With the system powered down, reach inside the reservoir to the front of the unit, gentry pull off the wire mesh filter. Make sure you only touch this mesh on the metal ring and do not squeeze the delicate mesh. Sonicate the mesh in acetone and then dilled water in lab 230.
1. Replace the water with distilled water by pouring additional water into the reservoir. Take care to avoid splashes here and find a small beaker if needed. There should be spare water under the desk in 233. Ask Mark if you need to buy more.

## Haskris
1. Switch off the Haskris. Open the screw connector on the front. Remove the water using the shop vac or another suitable pump. Remember that the filter inside the shop vac should be removed in order to avoid getting it wet. If there is debris at the bottom of the tank, consider agitating the water before transferring it.

1. We are currently installing an additional filter in this circuit. Please check it every six months and replace as necessary.
