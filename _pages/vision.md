## DigiCity
**DigiCity** is a part of DigiWorld - conrerstone of human activity, one of the last remaining marketplaces for physical interactions in the digitalized world. 
However, to make this interaction efficient, sustainable and accesible we need to leverage on emerging technologies and innovations. 
On the limited space, we need to find compromise between letting people and goods flow, creating liveable public spaces and reducing negative externalities.

Digiworld introduces tools, datasets and technologies to navigate humans in the complex, dynamic urban landscape. To shape policies of decisionmakers enabling citizens to benefit from emerging technologies (autonomous vehicles, micromobility, platform revolution) and provide Mobility-as-a-Service where ML and AI algorithms use data and models to understand and control emerging complexities.

### Environment - agent-based simulations of urban mobility
Let's consider a two-sided market, where two kinds of agents (supply and demand) are orchestrated with an intermediate platform. Each agent has its individual behaviour and takes independent actions to achieve personal goals. 
Travellers demand to travel, to reach their desired destinations at lowest perceived cost. 
Providers offer their services to supply this demand, they maximise their profit while competing with quality and level-of-service.
Platform matches demand with supply in real-time aiming to maximize market shares from which it benefits.

Those non-deterministic, non-linear, adaptive interactions take place in the complex, multimodal and congested urban transport network. Where traffic flows often exceed supply causing delays and activating bottleneck from which spillback may spread through the network. Public-transport, backbone that keeps mega cities in motion, with complex operations and NP-hard network design problems. 

Seamless and sustainable transport systems are key to the high quality urban space, where citizens may reach their destinations and participate in activities at low cost, both internal (personal discomfort) and external (emmission, congestion and space degragadation).

Our lab will follow the idea of **4xI**:
* will join core **international** transportation research community, through direct long-established links with leading labs in the field: TU Delft (ranked 1st outside of China in Shanghai's ranking), KTH Stockholm, TU Munich, University of Luxembourg, EPFL, DTU, La Sapienza.
* being **interdisciplinary** spanning from psychology, social sciences, economy, through complex systems, network science, game theory, demand forecasting up to machine learning, optimization, control.
* **innovating** landscape of urban mobility by applying cutting-edge algorithms, technology and models to improve daily operations
* being **integral** with society, helping to achieve the goals of **sustainable** urban transport, limiting its negative impact on environment and society.
