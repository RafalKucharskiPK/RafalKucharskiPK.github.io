Let's consider a two-sided market, where two kinds of agents (supply and demand) are orchestrated with an intermediate platform. Each agent has its individual behaviour and takes independent actions to achieve personal goals. 
Travellers demand to travel, to reach their desired destinations at lowest perceived cost. 
Providers offer their services to supply this demand, they maximise their profit while competing with quality and level-of-service.
Platform matches demand with supply in real-time aiming to maximize market shares from which it benefits.

Those non-deterministic, non-linear, adaptive interactions take place in the complex, multimodal and congested urban transport network. Where traffic flows often exceed supply causing delays and activating bottleneck from which spillback may spread through the network. Public-transport, backbone that keeps mega cities in motion, with complex operations and NP-hard network design problems. 

Seamless and sustainable transport systems are key to the high quality urban space, where citizens may reach their destinations and participate in activities at low cost, both internal (personal discomfort) and external (emmission, congestion and space degragadation).
