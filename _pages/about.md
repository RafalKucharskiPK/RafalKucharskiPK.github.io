I research complex social systems: urban mobility. Congested urban multimodal networks used by millions of agents to reach their destinations. Leaving huge mobility traces, ready to be applied for modelling, optimization, understanding and control.

I work with Oded Cats at TU Delft in his ERC Starting Grant. I model two-sided mobility platforms and focus on algorithms for ride-pooling (more than one person with Uber).

From 2021 to 2024 I will run the NCN Opus Grant on Shared Mobility in the pandemic times, we are looking for two prospective PhD students willing to research in Network Science and Behavioural Modelling.
