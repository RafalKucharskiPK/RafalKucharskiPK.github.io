I am a Physicist in the [Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science Department](https://www.bnl.gov/cmpmsd/) at [Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://www.bnl.gov). My research program focuses on resonant elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering studies of high temperature superconductors, strongly spin-orbit coupled materials, and complex oxide heterostructures.
