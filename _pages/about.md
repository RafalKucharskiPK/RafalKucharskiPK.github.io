<p>I am leading inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) program in the </p>
[Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science Department](https://www.bnl.gov/cmpmsd/) at [Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://www.bnl.gov). The research focuses on resonant elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering studies of high temperature superconductors, strongly spin-orbit coupled materials, and complex oxide heterostructures.
