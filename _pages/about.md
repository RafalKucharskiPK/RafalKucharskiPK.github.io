I research complex social systems: urban mobility. Congested, urban multimodal networks used by millions of agents to reach their destinations and leaving huge sets of mobility traces ready to be applied for modelling, optimization, understanding and control.

I work with Oded Cats at TU Delft in his ERC Starting Grant. I model two-sided mobility platforms and focus on algorithms for ride-pooling (more than one person with Uber).

See my bio, featured research and publications on this website.

From 2021 to 2024 I will run the NCN Opus Grant on Shared Mobility in the pandemic times, we are looking for two prospective PhD students willing to research in Network Science and Behavioural Modelling.
