I research complex social systems: *urban mobility*. Congested, urban multimodal networks used by millions of agents to reach their destinations and leaving huge sets of mobility traces ready to be applied for modelling, optimization, understanding and control. I work with Oded Cats at TU Delft in his ERC Starting Grant. I model two-sided mobility platforms and focus on algorithms for ride-pooling (more than one person with Uber). I did PhD with Guido Gentile in non-equilibrium dynamic traffic assignment.

In interdisciplinary field of _urban mobility_ I did research which can be classified as: 
* model estimation, optimization, system control, network design;
* agent-based simulation, game-theory, network science, stochastic simulation, epidemic modelling;
* machine learning, spatial analysis, big data analysis, pattern recognition, unsupervised learning;
* behavioural modelling, economic discrete choice models, policy, sustainability.


Outside of academia I was: 
* Data Scientist at [NorthGravity](https://www.northgravity.com/about_us) developing AWS-based protfolio or real-time production ready ML solutions
* R&D Developer at PTV SISTeMA implementing traffic flow algorithms into [PTV Optima](https://www.ptvgroup.com/en/solutions/products/ptv-optima/) real-time  traffic forecasting models.
* Transport Modeller using travel-diaries to estimate demand models and create strategic planning tools, e.g. for [Warsaw](http://transport.um.warszawa.pl/warszawskie-badanie-ruchu-2015/model-ruchu) and [Kraków](http://knsk.org/2015/01/krakowski-model-ruchu-2014/)

From 2021 to 2024 I will run the *NCN Opus Grant* on Shared Mobility in the pandemic times, we are looking for two prospective PhD students willing to research in Network Science and Behavioural Modelling in Kraków, Poland.
