Since   ride-hailing   has   become   an   important   travel   alternative   in   many   citiesworldwide,   a   fervent   debate   is   underway   on   whether   it   competes   with   orcomplements public transport  services. We use Uber trip data in six cities in  theUnited States and Europe to identify the most attractive public transport alternativefor  each   ride.  We   then   address  the   following  questions:  
* (i) How  does  ride-hailingtravel time and cost compare to the fastest public transport alternative?
* (ii) Whatproportion of ride-hailing trips that do not have a viable public transport alternative?
* (iii)   How   does     ride-hailing   change   overall   service   accessibility?  
* (iv)   What   is   therelation   between   demand   share   and   relative   competition   between   the   twoalternatives?

Our findings suggest that  the  dichotomy  -  competing  with  or  complementing  - isfalse. Though the vast majority of ride-hailing trips have a viable public transportalternative,   between   20%   and   40%   of   them   have   no   viable   public   transportalternative.  The   increased  service   accessibility attributed   to  the   inclusion  of  ride-hailing is greater in our US cities than in their European counterparts. Demand splitis directly related to the relative competitiveness of travel times i.e. when publictransport  travel times are competitive ride-hailing demand share  is low and vice-versa.
