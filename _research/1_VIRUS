    Figure 1: The resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) process. The initial, intermediate, and final
states are shown from left to right. Photons are represented as wavy red lines and electronic transitions are shown as green arrows. In this process spin excitations are created and their dispersion can be measured by determining the energy and momentum change of the photon.
