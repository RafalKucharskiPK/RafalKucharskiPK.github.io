  author={Dean, Mark PM and Howard, Christopher A and Saxena, Siddharth S and Ellerby, Mark},
  abstract={We report Raman-scattering measurements of BaC<sub>6</sub>, SrC<sub>6</sub>, YbC<sub>6</sub>, and CaC<sub>6</sub>, which permit a systematic study of the phonons and the electron-phonon interaction within the doped graphene layers of these compounds. The out-of-plane carbon phonon softens as the spacing of the graphene layers is reduced in the series BaC<sub>6</sub>, SrC<sub>6</sub>, YbC<sub>6</sub>, and CaC<sub>6</sub>. This is due to increasing charge in the  electronic band. Electron-phonon interaction effects between the in-plane carbon modes at 1500 cm<sup>−1</sup> and the  electrons cause a strong nonadiabatic renormalization. As charge is transferred into the  band, these nonadiabatic effects are found to increase concurrent with a reduction in the phonon lifetime.},

  abstract={We report combined soft and hard x-ray scattering studies of the electronic and lattice modulations associatedwith stripe order in La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> and La<sub>1.48</sub>Nd<sub>0.4</sub> Sr<sub>0.12</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>. We find that the amplitude of both the electronic modulation of the hole density and the strain modulation of the lattice is significantly larger in La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> than in La<sub>1.48</sub>Nd<sub>0.4</sub>Sr<sub>0.12</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> and is also better correlated. The in-plane correlation lengths are isotropic in each case; for La1.875Ba0.125CuO4, ξ hole = 255 ± 5 A, whereas for La<sub>1.48</sub>Nd<sub>0.4</sub>Sr<sub>0.12</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, ξ hole = 111 ± 7 A. We find that the modulations are temperature independent in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 in the low temperature tetragonal phase.
In contrast, in La1.48Nd0.4Sr0.12CuO4, the amplitude grows smoothly from zero, beginning 13 K below the LTT phase transition. We speculate that the reduced average tilt angle in La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> results in reduced charge localization and incoherent pinning, leading to the longer correlation length and enhanced periodic modulation

  title={Phonons in potassium-doped graphene: the effects of electron-phonon interactions, dimensionality, and adatom ordering},
  author={Howard, CA and Dean, MPM and Withers, F},
  abstract={Graphene phonons are measured as a function of electron doping via the addition of potassium adatoms. In the low doping regime, the in-plane carbon G peak hardens and narrows with increasing doping, analogous to the trend seen in graphene doped via the field effect. At high dopings, beyond those accessible by the field effect, the G peak strongly softens and broadens. This is interpreted as a dynamic, nonadiabatic renormalization of the phonon self-energy. At dopings between the light and heavily doped regimes, we find a robust inhomogeneous phase where the potassium coverage is segregated into regions of high and low density. The phonon energies, linewidths, and tunability are notably very similar for one- to four-layer potassium-doped graphene, but significantly different to bulk potassium-doped graphite.},

The study was designed to address hitherto unexplored aspects of the lattice dynamics in CaC<sub>6</sub>, and, in particular, any renormalization of the out-of-plane and in-plane graphitic phonon modes. We present a detailed comparison between the data and the results of density-functional theory DFT. A description is given of the analysis methods developed to account for the highly textured nature of the samples. The DFT calculations are shown to provide a good description of the general features of the experi- mental data. This is significant in light of a number of striking disagreements in the literature between other experiments and DFT on CaC<sub>6</sub>. The results presented here demonstrate that the disagreements are not due to any large inaccuracies in the calculated phonon frequencies.},

  abstract={The low-energy phonons of two different graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have been measured as a function of temperature using inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS). In the case of the non-superconductor BaC<sub>6</sub>, the phonons observed are significantly higher (up to 20%) in energy than those predicted by theory, in contrast to the reasonable agreement found in superconducting CaC<sub>6</sub>. Additional IXS intensity is observed below 15 meV in both BaC<sub>6</sub> and CaC<sub>6</sub>. It has been previously suggested that this additional inelastic intensity may arise from defect or vacancy modes not predicted by theory [d’Astuto et al., Phys. Rev. B 81, 104519 (2010)]. Here it is shown that this additional intensity can arise directly from the polycrystalline nature of the available samples. Our results show that future theoretical work is required to understand the relationship between the crystal structure, the phonons, and the superconductivity in GICs.},

Despite the fact that doping partially suppresses the antiferromagnetic transition, we find that magnetic order survives around the Ir dopant sites. The Ir states are magnetically polarized with commensurate stripe-like antiferromagnetic order and long correlations lengths, ξmag>2800 and >850 Å, in the ab plane and along the c axis, respectively, driven by their interaction with the Fe spins. This Ir magnetic order persists up to the Néel transition of the majority Fe spins at TN=74(2) K. At 5 K we find that magnetic order coexists microscopically with superconductivity in Ba(Fe1−xIrx)2As2. The energy dependence of the XRMS through the Ir L3 edge shows a non-Lorentzian line shape, which we explain in terms of interference between Ir resonant scattering and Fe nonresonant magnetic scattering.},

  abstract={Cuprates and other high-temperature superconductors consist of two-dimensional layers that are crucial to their properties. The dynamics of the quantum spins in these layers lie at the heart of the mystery of the cuprates. In bulk cuprates such as La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, the presence of a weak coupling between the two-dimensional layers stabilizes a three-dimensional magnetic order up to high temperatures. In a truly two-dimensional system however, thermal spin fluctuations melt long-range order at any finite temperature8. Here, we measure the spin response of isolated layers of La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> that are only one-unit-cell-thick. We show that coherent magnetic excitations, magnons, known from the bulk order, persist even in a single layer of La2CuO4, with no evidence for more complex correlations such as resonating valence bond correlations9,10,11. These magnons are, therefore, well described by spin-wave theory (SWT). On the other hand, we also observe a high-energy magnetic continuum in the isotropic magnetic response that is not well described by two-magnon SWT, or indeed any existing theories.},

Broad, dispersive magnetic excitations are observed, with a zone boundary energy of ∼ 300 meV and a weak dependence on doping. These excitations are strikingly similar to the bosons proposed to explain the high-energy "kink" observed in photoemission. A phenomenological calculation of the spin response, based on a parametrization of the the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy derived electronic structure and Yang-Rice-Zhang quasiparticles, provides a reasonable prediction of the energy dispersion of the observed magnetic excitations. These results indicate a possible unified framework to reconcile the magnetic and electronic properties of the cuprates and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach.},

The magnetic excitation peak is asymmetric, indicating the presence of single and multi-spin-flip excitations. As the hole doping level is increased, the zone boundary magnon energy is suppressed at a much larger rate than that in hole doped cuprates. Based on the analysis of the orbital and charge excitations observed by RIXS, we argue that this difference is related to the orbital character of the doped holes in these two families. This work establishes RIXS as a probe of fundamental magnetic interactions in nickelates opening the way towards studies of heterostructures and ultrafast pump-probe experiments.},

  abstract={While charge density wave (CDW) instabilities are ubiquitous to superconducting cuprates, the different ordering wave vectors in various cuprate families have hampered a unified description of the CDW formation mechanism. Here, we investigate the temperature dependence of the low-energy phonons in the canonical CDW-ordered cuprate La1.875Ba0.125CuO4. We discover that the phonon softening wave vector associated with CDW correlations becomes temperature dependent in the high-temperature precursor phase and changes from a wave vector of 0.238 reciprocal lattice units (r.l.u.) below the ordering transition temperature to 0.3 r.l.u. at 300 K. This high-temperature behavior shows that “214”-type cuprates can host CDW correlations at a similar wave vector to previously reported CDW correlations in non-214-type cuprates such as YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6+δ</sub>. This indicates that cuprate CDWs may arise from the same underlying instability despite their apparently different low-temperature ordering wave vectors.},

    abstract={Fundamental control of magnetic coupling through heterostructure morphology is a prerequisite for rational engineering of magnetic ground states. We report the tuning of magnetic interactions in superlattices composed of single and bilayers of SrIrO<sub>3</sub> inter-spaced with SrTiO<sub>3</sub> in analogy to the Ruddlesden-Popper series iridates. Magnetic scattering shows predominately c-axis antiferromagnetic orientation of the magnetic moments for the bilayer, as in Sr<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. However, the magnetic excitation gap, measured by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, is quite different between the two structures, evidencing a significant change in the stability of the competing magnetic phases. In contrast, the single layer iridate hosts a more bulk-like gap. We find these changes are driven by bending of the c-axis Ir-O-Ir bond, which is much weaker in the single layer, and subsequent local environment changes, evidenced through x-ray diffraction and magnetic excitation modeling. Our findings demonstrate how large changes in the magnetic interactions can be tailored and probed in spin-orbit coupled heterostructures by engineering subtle structural modulations.},

  abstract={A fundamental difference between antiferromagnets and ferromagnets is the lack of linear coupling to a uniform magnetic field due to the staggered order parameter1. Such coupling is possible via the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) interaction2,3, but at the expense of reduced antiferromagnetic (AFM) susceptibility due to the canting-induced spin anisotropy4. We solve this long-standing problem with a top-down approach that utilizes spin–orbit coupling in the presence of a hidden SU(2) symmetry. We demonstrate giant AFM responses to sub-tesla external fields by exploiting the extremely strong two-dimensional critical fluctuations preserved under a symmetry-invariant exchange anisotropy, which is built into a square lattice artificially synthesized as a superlattice of SrIrO<sub>3</sub> and SrTiO<sub>3</sub>. The observed field-induced logarithmic increase of the ordering temperature enables highly efficient control of the AFM order.

These excitations encode the correlations and interactions that determine the detailed properties of the states generated. After outlining the basic principles and instrumentations of tr-RIXS, we review our first observations of transient antiferromagnetic correlations in quasi two dimensions in a photo-excited Mott insulator and present possible future routes of this fast-developing technique.

  abstract={The electronic states of many Mott insulators, including iridates, are often conceptualized in terms of localized atomic states such as the famous “J<sub>eff</sub>=1/2 state.” Although orbital hybridization can strongly modify such states and dramatically change the electronic properties of materials, probing this process is highly challenging. In this Letter, we directly detect and quantify the formation of dimer orbitals in an iridate material Ba<sub>5</sub>AlIr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>11</sub> using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. Sharp peaks corresponding to the excitations of dimer orbitals are observed and analyzed by a combination of density functional theory calculations and theoretical simulations based on an Ir-Ir cluster model. Such partially delocalized dimer states lead to a redefinition of the angular momentum of the electrons and changes in the magnetic and electronic behaviors of the material. We use this to explain the reduction of the observed magnetic moment with respect to predictions based on atomic states. This study opens new directions to study dimerization in a large family of materials, including solids, heterostructures, molecules, and transient states.},

Using synchrotron radiation to measure the x-ray linear dichroism of epitaxially strained films of the correlated oxide CaFeO3, we demonstrate that the orbital polarization of the Fe valence electrons is opposite from conventional understanding. Although the energetic ordering of the Fe $$3d$$ orbitals is confirmed by multiplet ligand field theory analysis to be consistent with previously reported strain-induced behavior, we find that the nominally higher energy orbital is more populated than the lower. We ascribe this inverted orbital polarization to an anisotropic bandwidth response to strain in a compound with nearly filled bands. These findings provide an important counterexample to the traditional understanding of strain-induced orbital polarization and reveal a method to engineer otherwise unachievable orbital occupations in correlated oxides.},

Recent breakthroughs in Antiferromagnetic Spintronics brought up novel concepts for electronic device development. Imaging antiferromagnetic domains is of key importance to this field. Unfortunately, some of the basic domain types, such as antiphase domains, cannot be imaged by conventional techniques. Herein, we present a new domain projection imaging technique based on the localization of domain boundaries by resonant magnetic diffraction of coherent X rays. Contrast arises from reduction of the scattered intensity at the domain boundaries due to destructive interference effects. We demonstrate this approach by imaging antiphase domains in a collinear antiferromagnet Fe<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, and observe evidence of domain wall interaction with a structural defect. This technique does not involve any numerical algorithms. It is fast, sensitive, produces large-scale images in a single-exposure measurement, and is applicable to a variety of magnetic domain types.},

  abstract={Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has become a very powerful experimental technique to probe a broad range of intrinsic elementary excitations, for example, from low energy phonons and (bi-)magnons to high energy -, charge-transfer and plasmon excitations in strongly correlated electronic systems. Due to the complexity of the RIXS cross-section and strong core-hole effects, theoretical simulation of the experimental RIXS spectra is still a difficult task which hampers the understanding of RIXS spectra and the development of the RIXS technique. In this paper, we present an open source toolkit (dubbed EDRIXS) to facilitate the simulations of RIXS spectra of strongly correlated materials based on exact diagonalization (ED) of certain model Hamiltonians. The model Hamiltonian can be from a single atom, small cluster or Anderson impurity model, with model parameters from density functional theory plus Wannier90 or dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The spectra of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and RIXS are then calculated using Krylov subspace techniques. This toolkit contains highly efficient ED, XAS and RIXS solvers written in modern Fortran 90 language and a convenient Python library used to prepare inputs and set up calculations. We first give a short introduction to RIXS spectroscopy, and then we discuss the implementation details of this toolkit. Finally, we show three examples to demonstrate its usage.},
