  journal={Physical Review B},
  abstract={Manipulating the orbital occupation of valence electrons via epitaxial strain in an effort to induce new functional properties requires considerations of how changes in the local bonding environment affect the band structure at the Fermi level. Using synchrotron radiation to measure the x-ray linear dichroism of epitaxially strained films of the correlated oxide CaFeO3, we demonstrate that the orbital polarization of the Fe valence electrons is opposite from conventional understanding. Although the energetic ordering of the Fe $$3d$$ orbitals is confirmed by multiplet ligand field theory analysis to be consistent with previously reported strain-induced behavior, we find that the nominally higher energy orbital is more populated than the lower. We ascribe this inverted orbital polarization to an anisotropic bandwidth response to strain in a compound with nearly filled bands. These findings provide an important counterexample to the traditional understanding of strain-induced orbital polarization and reveal a method to engineer otherwise unachievable orbital occupations in correlated oxides.},

  journal={Nature communications},
  abstract={Manipulating magnetic domains is essential for many technological applications. Recent breakthroughs in Antiferromagnetic Spintronics brought up novel concepts for electronic device development. Imaging antiferromagnetic domains is of key importance to this field. Unfortunately, some of the basic domain types, such as antiphase domains, cannot be imaged by conventional techniques. Herein, we present a new domain projection imaging technique based on the localization of domain boundaries by resonant magnetic diffraction of coherent X rays. Contrast arises from reduction of the scattered intensity at the domain boundaries due to destructive interference effects. We demonstrate this approach by imaging antiphase domains in a collinear antiferromagnet Fe<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, and observe evidence of domain wall interaction with a structural defect. This technique does not involve any numerical algorithms. It is fast, sensitive, produces large-scale images in a single-exposure measurement, and is applicable to a variety of magnetic domain types.},

  title={EDRIXS: An open source toolkit for simulating spectra of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering},
  author={Wang, YL and Fabbris, G and Dean, MPM and Kotliar, G},
  journal={Computer Physics Communications},
  abstract={Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has become a very powerful experimental technique to probe a broad range of intrinsic elementary excitations, for example, from low energy phonons and (bi-)magnons to high energy -, charge-transfer and plasmon excitations in strongly correlated electronic systems. Due to the complexity of the RIXS cross-section and strong core-hole effects, theoretical simulation of the experimental RIXS spectra is still a difficult task which hampers the understanding of RIXS spectra and the development of the RIXS technique. In this paper, we present an open source toolkit (dubbed EDRIXS) to facilitate the simulations of RIXS spectra of strongly correlated materials based on exact diagonalization (ED) of certain model Hamiltonians. The model Hamiltonian can be from a single atom, small cluster or Anderson impurity model, with model parameters from density functional theory plus Wannier90 or dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The spectra of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and RIXS are then calculated using Krylov subspace techniques. This toolkit contains highly efficient ED, XAS and RIXS solvers written in modern Fortran 90 language and a convenient Python library used to prepare inputs and set up calculations. We first give a short introduction to RIXS spectroscopy, and then we discuss the implementation details of this toolkit. Finally, we show three examples to demonstrate its usage.},

  abstract={We report the first empirical demonstration that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) is sensitive to collective magnetic excitations in S=1 systems by probing the Ni L<sub>3</sub> edge of La<sub>2âˆ’x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>NiO<sub>4</sub> (x=0, 0.33, 0.45). The magnetic excitation peak is asymmetric, indicating the presence of single and multi-spin-flip excitations. As the hole doping level is increased, the zone boundary magnon energy is suppressed at a much larger rate than that in hole doped cuprates. Based on the analysis of the orbital and charge excitations observed by RIXS, we argue that this difference is related to the orbital character of the doped holes in these two families. This work establishes RIXS as a probe of fundamental magnetic interactions in nickelates opening the way towards studies of heterostructures and ultrafast pump-probe experiments.},

  abstract={Although CDW correlations are a ubiquitous feature of the superconducting cuprates, their disparate properties suggest a crucial role for pinning the CDW to the lattice. Here, we report coherent resonant X-ray speckle correlation analysis, which directly determines the reproducibility of CDW domain patterns in La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (LBCO 1/8) with thermal cycling. While CDW order is only observed below 54â€‰K, where a structural phase transition creates inequivalent Cu-O bonds, we discover remarkably reproducible CDW domain memory upon repeated cycling to far higher temperatures. That memory is only lost on cycling to 240(3)â€‰K, which recovers the four-fold symmetry of the CuO<sub>2</sub> planes. We infer that the structural features that develop below 240â€‰K determine the CDW pinning landscape below 54â€‰K. This opens a view into the complex coupling between charge and lattice degrees of freedom in superconducting cuprates.},

  abstract={Ruddlesden-Popper type Sr<sub>n+1</sub>Ir<sub>n</sub>O<sub>3n+1</sub> compounds are a major focus of condensed matter physics, where the subtle balance between electron-electron correlation, spinâ€“orbit interaction, and crystal field effect brings a host of emergent phenomena. While it is understandable that a canted antiferromagnetic insulating state with an easy-plane anisotropy is developed in Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> as the two-dimensional limit of the series, it is intriguing that bilayer Sr<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, with slightly higher effective dimensionality, stabilizes c-axis collinear antiferromagnetism. This also renders Sr3Ir2O7 a unique playground to study exotic physics near a critical spin transition point. However, the epitaxial growth of Sr3Ir2O7 is still a challenging task because of the narrow growth window. In our research, we have studied the thermodynamic process during the synthesis of Sr<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> thin films. We expanded the synthesis window by mapping out the relationship between the thin film crystal structure and the gas pressure. Our work thus provides a more accessible avenue to stabilize metastable materials.},

  abstract={We present a methodology based on ex situ (postgrowth) electrochemistry to control the oxygen concentration in thin films of the superconducting oxide La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4+y</sub>
 grown epitaxially on substrates of isostructural LaSrAlO4. The superconducting transition temperature, which depends on the oxygen concentration, can be tuned by adjusting the pH level of the base solution used for the electrochemical reaction. As our main finding, we demonstrate that the dopant oxygens can either occupy the interstitial layer in an orientationally disordered state or organize into a crystalline phase via a mechanism in which dopant oxygens are inserted into the substrate, changing the lattice symmetry of both the substrate and the epitaxial film. We discuss this mechanism, and we describe the resulting methodology as a platform to be explored in thin films of other transition-metal oxides.},
