Derek lead the group's research on iridate-titanate heterostructures. He developed new approaches to measure [magnon dispersion](/me/publications/#meyers2019magnetism) and [electron phonon coupling](/me/publications/#meyers2018decoupling) in these systems. He also worked on [ultrafast RIXS](/me/publications/#cao2019ultrafast) and a breakthrough study about the [how these systems couple to applied magnetic field](/me/publications/#hao2018giant).  This is part of a very successful collaboration with [Jian Liu's group at the University of Tennessee](http://www.phys.utk.edu/faculty/faculty-liu.html).

Derek is now an Assistant Professor in the Physics Department at Oklahoma State University.
