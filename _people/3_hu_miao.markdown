Hu Miao's main research area is charge density waves in copper-oxide superconductors. He made the first observation of [precursor CDW correlations with RIXS](/me/publications/#miao2017high), [temperature induced changes in the CDW wavevector](/me/publications/#miao2018incommensurate), and [doping independent CDW correlations](/me/publications/#miao2019incommensurate). He also had the very inventive idea of studying topological effects in phonon band structures resulting in the measurement of [double Weyl phonons](/me/publications/#miao2018double).
